## Introduction

There are four developers contributing to the project, Yuxuan Zhou(yuz211@pitt.edu), Chenhao Huang(chh212@pitt.edu), Yifei Tai(yit43@pitt.edu), and Zhouxin Tian(zht14@pitt.edu). Our project focuses on imitating the used phones e-commerce platform. We thrive to provide users with an excellent purchasing experience for those who demand used phones. In general, there are two types of users in our system: 1. Customer, 2. Admin. For customers, they could browse,select, purchase and manage the items or orders listed in the system. For the admin, he or she could manage the existing products in the system, and could also get access to the data analysis dashboard of the selling platform.

## Objective

Our main objective is to facilitate the circulation of used cell phones, and provide a prominent purchasing experience for buyers. We desire to solve the problem that buyers could not find cost-effective equipment that aligns with their needs. Our used phone e-commerce platform could provide users another option to get access to the cheaper equipment, and also reduce the situation of wasting resources caused by disposal of used electronic devices in a short time because of the lack of a circulation platform. We crave learning about the full stack development techniques, software development pattern, and also the logic behind running e-commerce platform. Besides the requirement of the project, we implemented the user permanent JWT token to increase the security of API calls and utilized third party libraries to increase the dynamics of the front-end.

## Contribution

1. Yifei Tai: implementation of backend and the deployment of cloud
2. Zhouxin Tian: database architecture and design doc writing
3. Chenhao Huang: implementation of front-end and middleware data connectivity
4. Yuxuan Zhou: Integration of backend and frontend and overall principle of different layers of implementation(Zhou is the principal engineer of this project)

## Technical Architecture

### Fond-end technology stack:

1. React
2. Tailwind CSS
3. React-hook-form
4. React-hot-toast
5. React built in API
6. Dot env (Separate development and production environment)
7. JWT token (Enhance security for the REST API calls)
8. Role based access control
9. Context (Increase modularity)

### Bank-end technology stack:

1. Express(MVC)
2. DB diagram

## Challenges

The most challenging parts for our group to handle during the development are below:

1. React framework understanding(state management, react hook, syntax and so on)
2. Implementation of inversion of control
3. Project deployment

We initially want to utilize Next.js and storybook, but because of the time constraints and variation of the project during development, we do not have a chance to use them at last. Fortunately, all the features that we planned to implement works. For us, the first problem is the differences in different design docs. Half of the teams are looking forward to the application of the front-end integrated system, and the other part of the teammates hope to use REACT’s strength to implement different components. But through this process, we are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when we disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. We have conviction and are tenacious. We find the best way to implement our structure which is the one you see right now. We do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly. That’s how we face our challenges.

## Future work

First, We expect and require innovation and invention from our teams and always find ways to simplify our existing structure that serve our purpose the best. We will be externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. Being better and raising the bar will always be our goal. So we are open to implementing more cutting-edge tech stacks and innovative ideas about system design. Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. We think differently and look around corners for ways to serve our potential customers.

## Conclusion

Yes, we think we learn what we want. We also have relentlessly high standards and are willing to drive ourselves to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. In this project, the lecture about CSS break-point(Aesthetic related aspects), javascript topic, and NoSQL(MongoDB) would be useful.
